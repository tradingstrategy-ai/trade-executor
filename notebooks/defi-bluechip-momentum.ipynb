    "# DeFi bluechip token momentum trading strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an example notebook how to construct a momentum based portfolio construction strategy\n",
    "using [Trading Strategy framework](https://tradingstrategy.ai/docs/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some highlights of this notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Make sure you have studied some simpler backtesting examples first\n",
    "* The backtest has all its code within a single Jupyter notebook\n",
    "    - The backtest code and charts are self-contained in a single file\n",
    "    - The example code is easy to read\n",
    "    - Easy to test different functionalities of [tradeexecutor](https://tradingstrategy.ai/docs/programming/api/execution/index.html) library\n",
    "* Runs a backtest for a momentum strategy\n",
    "    - Uses handpicked \"DeFi bluechip tokens\"\n",
    "    - Trade across multiple blockchains\n",
    "    - Trade across multiple DEXes\n",
    "    - Based on momentum\n",
    "    - Weekly rebalances\n",
    "    - Long only\n",
    "    - Supports stop loss\n",
    "    - Ignore price impact, and thus may cause unrealistic results\n",
    "    - Ignore available liquidity to trade, and thus may cause unrealistic results\n",
    "* Demostrates statistics and performance analyses\n",
    "    - Equity curve with multiple pairs to compare\n",
    "    - Aggregated monthly performance\n",
    "* Order routing is ignored; the strategy cannot be moved to live trading as is\n",
    "    - We use the oldest available DEX price data we have: Uniswap v2, others\n",
    "    - For live trade execution, one would want to choose execution on a newer DEX with less fees\n",
    "* You need a [Trading Strategy API key](https://tradingstrategy.ai/trading-view/backtesting) to run the notebook\n",
    "* This backtest is made to demostrate the features\n",
    "    - The strategy may or may not generate any profits, as it is not the purpose of this example\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a unit test version availble in the repository in `tests/strategy_tests`.\n"
