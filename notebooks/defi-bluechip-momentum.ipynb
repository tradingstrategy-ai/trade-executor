    "# Portfolio construction model trading strategy example\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an example notebook how to construct a momentum based portfolio construction strategy\n",
    "using [Trading Strategy framework](https://tradingstrategy.ai/docs/) and backtest it for DeFi tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "This backtest uses alpha model approach where each trading pair has a signal\n",
    "and basede on the signal strenghts we construct new portfolio weightings \n",
    "for the upcoming week.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some highlights of this notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Not a realistic trading strategy, but more of an code example** - this may generate profits or loss but this is outside the scode of this example\n",
    "* Make sure you have studied some simpler backtesting examples first\n",
    "* The backtest has all its code within a single Jupyter notebook\n",
    "    - The backtest code and charts are self-contained in a single file\n",
    "    - The example code is easy to read\n",
    "* Runs a backtest for a momentum strategy\n",
    "    - Uses handpicked \"DeFi bluechip tokens\" - see *Trading universe definition* for the list\n",
    "    - Long only    \n",
    "    - Pick top 3 tokens for each strategy cycle\n",
    "    - Trade across multiple blockchains\n",
    "    - Trade across multiple DEXes\n",
    "    - Based on momentum (previous week price change %)\n",
    "    - Weekly rebalances - weekly strategy cycle\n",
    "    - Supports stop loss - although not used in this example\n",
    "    - Ignore price impact, and thus may cause unrealistic results\n",
    "    - Ignore available liquidity to trade, and thus may cause unrealistic results\n",
    "    - Ignore any complications of trading assets cross chain - we assume our reserve currency USDC is good on any chain and DEX and trading pair,\n",
    "      which is not a realistic assumption\n",
    "* Demostrates statistics and performance analyses\n",
    "    - Equity curve with comparison to buy and hold ETH\n",
    "    - Alpha model \n",
    "    - Aggregated monthly performance\n",
    "* Order routing is ignored; the strategy cannot be moved to live trading as is\n",
    "    - We use the oldest available DEX price data we have: Uniswap v2, others\n",
    "    - For live trade execution, one would want to choose execution on a newer DEX with less fees\n",
    "* You need a [Trading Strategy API key](https://tradingstrategy.ai/trading-view/backtesting) to run the notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a unit test version availble in the repository in `tests/strategy_tests`.\n"
