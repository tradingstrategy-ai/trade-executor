# Lagoon Lighter deployment

`lagoon-deploy-vault` can create the Lighter account owned by a fresh
Ethereum Lagoon Safe and register its trading API key:

```shell
export JSON_RPC_ETHEREUM="https://..."
export PRIVATE_KEY="0x..."
export DENOMINATION_ASSET="0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48"
export VAULT_RECORD_FILE="/secure/path/vault-record.txt"
export GENERATE_LIGHTER_API_KEY=true
export LIGHTER_API_KEY_INDEX=4

trade-executor lagoon-deploy-vault
```

The activation spends the fixed, Lagoon-accounted 1 USDC deposit and waits for
Lighter public state before executing `changePubKey`. It is Ethereum-only and
cannot be simulated on a private Anvil fork. Enabling it therefore spends real
gas and USDC.

The configured record path receives the public text record and a paired JSON
operator record. The JSON file is created with mode `0600` and contains the
generated private key only for an enabled activation. Back it up in the secret
manager immediately; never paste it into tickets, chat or diagnostics. The
Markdown report, text record and `state/{executor-id}.deployment.json` runtime
artefact contain the account index, API-key index, public key, transaction
hashes and observed collateral, but never the private key.

## Strategy accounting

Use the public account index from the deployment report when constructing a
strategy universe:

```python
from tradeexecutor.exchange_account.lighter import create_lighter_exchange_account_pair

lighter_pair = create_lighter_exchange_account_pair(
    quote=universe.get_reserve_asset(),
    account_index=123,
)
```

The pair is an external exchange-account position. Runtime valuation uses
Lighter's unauthenticated public API, so the executor never needs the API
private key. The Lagoon NAV formula is:

```text
Safe USDC balance at the treasury-sync block
+ Lighter total_asset_value
+ pending Lagoon settlement value
```

The Safe balance is reconciled separately and is not included in the external
account position. Stop the executor while collateral is moving between the
Safe and Lighter, and resume only after the public account response reflects
the settlement. A negative or malformed Lighter equity response aborts the
cycle; it is never cached, written to state or posted as NAV.
